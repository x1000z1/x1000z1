### 👨‍💻 Professional Summary

I am a 3rd-year **Software Engineering & Mobile Applications** student transitioning into **Systems Programming**.

While my academic background provides a solid foundation in software architecture and mobile development lifecycles, my professional interest lies in **Rust**. I am passionate about building software that respects system resources—focusing on memory safety, concurrency, and zero-cost abstractions.

* 🌱 **Currently mastering:** Rust Ecosystem (`egui`, `tokio`, FFI).
* 📱 **Academic focus:** Mobile Application Development.
* 🔧 **Advocate for:** Low-code solutions for rapid business prototyping.

### 🚀 Engineering Highlights

**[The Forge Macro (TFM)](https://github.com/x1000z1/the-forge-macro)**
*A standalone, high-performance desktop automation tool written in Rust.*

I developed TFM to explore the limits of efficient desktop automation. Unlike standard script-based solutions, TFM is a compiled binary that prioritizes safety and low resource consumption.

* **Core Logic:** Implements human-like behavior algorithms using `rand` to ensure safe interactions.
* **System Integration:** Utilizes `enigo` for cross-platform input simulation and `active-win-pos-rs` for strict window context awareness.
* **UI:** Built with **egui (eframe)** to provide a lightweight, immediate-mode graphical interface.
