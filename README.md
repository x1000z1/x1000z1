# Hi, I'm Patryk

I'm an IT student passionate about backend development, especially in Java and Spring Boot. I enjoy learning by building real projects and exploring new technologies.
I'm currently deepening my knowledge of software architecture, clean code practices, and RESTful API design. I believe in learning by doing and constantly challenging myself with new tools and concepts.

### Interests

I like reading books about Java and modern technologies â€” always trying to level up my backend skills. I'm especially interested in topics like system design, microservices, and cloud-native development.
