I'm an IT student passionate about backend development, particularly with Java and Spring Boot. I love learning through building real-world projects and exploring new technologies. Currently, I'm focused on deepening my knowledge in software architecture, clean code principles, and RESTful API design. I strongly believe in learning by doing and constantly challenging myself with new tools and concepts.

### Interests
I'm an avid reader of books on Java and modern backend technologies â€” always aiming to sharpen my skills. My main interests include system design, microservices, and cloud-native development. I'm also comfortable working in both Windows and Linux environments (especially Fedora), which helps me stay flexible and adaptable across different development setups.
