### Hey there! 👋

I'm **Patryk**, a Software Engineering & Mobile Apps student based in Poland.

I study application architecture by day, but my real passion lies in **Systems Programming**.
I love building software that is not only functional but blazing fast and memory-safe.

My main tech stack focus right now is **Rust** (especially combined with `egui`). I am also a huge advocate for **Low-code** solutions to speed up business prototyping.

I've got a few projects in the works, but my favorite is [The Forge Macro (TFM)](https://github.com/x1000z1/the-forge-macro).
It's a high-performance automation tool I built entirely in Rust to explore safe desktop input simulation and GUI rendering.

I'm currently in my 3rd year of university, constantly bridging the gap between academic theory and practical, modern performance coding.

**Fun Facts:**

* 🦀 I'm betting my future career on Rust.
* ⚡ Obsessed with optimization and lightweight software.
* **Hobbies:** coding, tech trends.
